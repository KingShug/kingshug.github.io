                    Im glad I finally had to leave.

                        working for two years hadn't left me flat broke. So I finally left and went off to sort my self out its been a long fight<br><br>

                            Fair enough well after all that having been working out my head and working a 9-5 at my local pharmacy, I had recovered<br>
                            finacially (kinda still broke just not debt broke) and mentally, not physically thats another story but hey I lost 30lbs so<br>
                            silver lining. I was well("ish") but I was missing something it wasn't till my father of all people sugessted that I find<br>
                            something cathartic to focus on so I thought hey i've always been to down to finish that video game I started writing ill give<br>
                            that a shot and from there I mentioned to a friend that I was writing again and he said that he and another friend were working<br>
                            on a game and that I should join them so I did and I thought that why am I just going to write all day I should figure out how<br>
                            games are made. So I started studying game development and from there I started studying how programming works and how networking<br>
                            works and then I got lost so I went back to programming and I started discovering all these new resources that didn't excist when<br>
                            I was first coming up and what wild is ever since I started on this journey just a short time ago this has been the happiest I have<br>
                            ever been and I can't even put into words the emotions I go through every time I learn something new every day so far has been<br>
                            better than any day I have had yet. This is my life now Its sound crazy but I don't really have a say in the matter anymore<br><br>
                            SOOOOOO......<br><br><br>

                            Look I have a really long way to go, like the rest of my life long, but honestly im looking forward to tommorow for the first time<br>
                            in my life. So look out all you CodeMasters im comming your way it may take me decades but im chasing after you full sprint<br>
                            and I know ill get there so I hope your all ready to<br>

                Introducing my first official project! <b>This Site!!</b><br>Is it the best looking... no.<br>Could I have made it in wordpress in a fraction of the time.... Yes I did in fact and its Argubly better than this version.<br> BUT!. I wanted to challenge myself and I place extreme value on the skills and experience I gained in this endevor. I learned <b>HTML</b> <b>CSS</b> <b>Java...</b>kinda. I figured out how to be a google assasin taking each line function and snippet of code peice by peice and that built and incredible ammount of confidance in my ability to learn. I already have so many ideas on how to improve this site and I plan on breaking it and putting it back togather regularly<br>I made a plan and I didn't know how to do it but I found a way to execute my plan.<br>I even set myself a deadline so that I can practice working under pressure and I've got an hour left and no sweat I got this!<br>(ok so a fair ammount of sweat)<br>I love this If I could spend all day doing this I would no holds barred this is my future....<br>Something being hard only makes it worth more when you have it....
